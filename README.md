# Imager
Trends Task

AhmeDroid



Approach in this project:

MVVM

Clean Code Rules applied

Clean Architecture implemented in a light way

DI - using Hilt

Android Architecture Components



Notes:
No comments, as per Clean Code book written by uncle bob

Core module should have base classes but I decided to omit them

I didn't use usecases and made the viewmodels communicate directly with the repos.
